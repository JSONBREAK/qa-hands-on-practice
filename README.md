# 📦 QA Incident Case Studies

This repository contains **real-world–style QA incident case studies** focused on
**bug investigation, root cause analysis, and prevention**.

It is designed to demonstrate how a QA engineer handles incidents
from detection to resolution and regression prevention.

> ⚠️ This is **not a learning or tutorial repository**.  
> All cases are written as **job-simulation scenarios** based on real production patterns.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to showcase:

- Incident-driven QA thinking
- Structured bug reporting
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) using system thinking
- Regression and prevention mindset
- How QA contributes beyond finding bugs

This repository complements my learning repository and focuses on
**practical application rather than theory**.

---

## 🧠 QA Mindset Behind This Repo

- Incidents come first, documentation follows
- Focus on **facts before assumptions**
- Root cause over symptoms
- Prevention is more important than quick fixes
- QA is part of system quality, not just testing

## 📄 Incident Case Format

Each incident is documented as **one complete Markdown file** and typically includes:

1. Incident Summary  
2. Bug Report  
3. Impact Assessment  
4. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)  
5. Resolution  
6. Test Cases Added After Incident  
7. Prevention & Lessons Learned  

This format reflects how incidents are documented in real QA / engineering teams.

---

## 🧪 Types of Incidents Covered

- Login / authentication failures
- Regression after release
- Data and migration issues
- API and integration failures
- Configuration and environment issues

Incidents may be simulated but are written to closely match
**real production behavior**.
